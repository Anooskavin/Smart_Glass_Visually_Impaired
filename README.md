SMART GLASS FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED

PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION 


FIELD OF THE INVENTION: 

According to the official statistics from the World Health Organization, there are about 285 million visually impaired persons in the world up to the year of 2011. In this 39 million persons were completely blind and 246 million have weak sight. This number will increase rapidly. People with visual impairment face many types of hurdles in performing everyday routine works. They are embarrassed many times while performing the activities, when they are unsuccessful in performing or completing them, because of their visual impairment deficiency. In this covid’19 pandemic situation , the important issue is maintaining social distancing . But however, it is not possible to be followed all the time by everyone. At Least we can maintain a distance from the people who are not wearing masks.


OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION: 

The wave of Covid-19 pandemic has certainly changed lifestyles of people across the world. It has particularly worsened the situation furthermore for those with vision loss. From mobility to employment, from experience of touch to taking assistance from sighted guides, from availing health services to education, from financial stability to psychological state, all of them have taken for the prevailing situation. Some of the safety measures such as social distancing may not be conducive for them as most times. So they rely on assistance from sighted guides for moving around. For this Post covid scenario the critical problem is retaining social distancing however it isn't always feasible to keep the distance from everybody.
In order to help the visually impaired people from obstacles the Smart glass is developed. In the proposed design, a wearable device which works on the basis of computer vision, machine learning and image processing. A raspberry pi camera was used for image acquisition. It was connected to the raspberry pi using a ﬂex cable, and was ﬁxed on the top middle of the glass for optimal image capturing with the help of Image processing and Deep learning. The raspberry pi has an audio port which connects to the earpiece. The raspberry pi GPIO port was conﬁgured to receive input. Trained Datasets are stored in the raspberry pi for face recognition.


SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: 

Smart class for the Visually challenged people will be useful for their entire lifetime for identify the known faces and to know their health protocols. In short Term the Face mask detection is very useful for the blind people to maintain social distance from others. This is mainly very helpful for the eldery people. It will remind elder people when passerby is without mask or with mask. The face recognition using the predefined dataset of relatives images which is used to recognize the known people for the device user. so, this will be an Long Term Outcome.

ETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION: 

Visual impairment, also known as vision impairment or vision loss, is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glass. Some also include those who have a decreased ability to see because they do not have access to glass or contact lenses. Visual impairment is often defined as a best corrected visual acuity of worse than either 20/40 or 20/60. The term blindness is used for complete or nearly complete vision loss. Visual impairment may cause difficulties with normal daily activities such as reading and walking without adaptive training and equipment 

Artificial Intelligence technology is used for analyzing the data to predict future outcomes. It solves a lot of real-time problems. The deep learning algorithm gains experience using the accumulated past and new large datasets, any technology employing deep learning benefits can make reliable predictions and also present factual responses to real-time data. The data faceprint stored via facial traits is compared by the face recognition software using these algorithms. It builds an analogy between the real-time data capture (digital image) and the stored database to identify an individual.

So, we use a deep conventional neural network for solving the identification of a particular person through image classification. Deep conventional neural network consists of four layers namely input layer, conventional layer, max-pooling layer, dropout layer, and output layer. In that input layer, we give people’s live input images. We use the people’s image dataset for training. We feed the people’s images as input to the conventional neural network not only for the face detection and too for the passerby check of mask compliance.

A wearable device which works on the basis of computer vision, machine learning and image processing. A raspberry pi camera was used for image acquisition. It was connected to the raspberry pi using a ﬂex cable, and was ﬁxed on the top middle of the glass for optimal image capturing with the help of Image processing and Deep learning. These images are trained at the Cloud server by CNN algorithm which uses OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier. Based on the accuracy level, the name of the person will be communicated through Voice commands. The raspberry pi has an audio port which connects to the earpiece. The raspberry pi GPIO port was conﬁgured to receive input. Trained Datasets are stored in the raspberry pi for face recognition.
